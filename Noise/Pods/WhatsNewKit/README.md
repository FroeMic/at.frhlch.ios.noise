## Features

- [x] Customization and Configuration to your needs üí™
- [x] Predefined Themes and Animations üé¨
- [x] Easily check if your Features have already been presented üéÅ
- [x] Awesome UI üòç

## Example

The example Application is an excellent way to see `WhatsNewKit` in action. You get a brief look of the available configuration options and how they affect the look and feel of the `WhatsNewViewController`. Simply open the `WhatsNewKit.xcodeproj` and run the `WhatsNewKit-Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

WhatsNewKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'WhatsNewKit', '~> 1.0.0'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate WhatsNewKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit" ~> 1.0.0
```

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework and drag the built `WhatsNewKit.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md)

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate WhatsNewKit into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage
The following first usage description shows the easiest way of presenting your new app features with `WhatsNewKit`.
> üë®‚Äçüíª Please see the [Advanced](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit#advanced) section for further configuration options and features.

### WhatsNew
To showcase your awesome new app features, simply setup a [WhatsNew](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Models/WhatsNew.swift) struct with a `title` and `items`. A [WhatsNew.Item](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Models/WhatsNew%2BItem.swift) represents a single feature that you want to showcase.

```swift
// Initialize WhatsNew
let whatsNew = WhatsNew(
    // The Title
    title: "WhatsNewKit",
    // The features you want to showcase
    items: [
        WhatsNew.Item(
            title: "Installation",
            subtitle: "You can install WhatsNewKit via CocoaPods or Carthage",
            image: .init(named: "installation")
        ),
        WhatsNew.Item(
            title: "Open Source",
            subtitle: "Contributions are very welcome üë®‚Äçüíª",
            image: .init(named: "openSource")
        )
    ]
)
```

### WhatsNewViewController 

The presentation of your new app features are handled via the [WhatsNewViewController](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/WhatsNewViewController.swift). Simply pass your `WhatsNew` struct to the initializer and present or push the `WhatsNewViewController`

```swift
// Initialize WhatsNewViewController with WhatsNew
let whatsNewViewController = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: whatsNew
)
// Present it
self.present(whatsNewViewController, animated: true)
```

## Advanced
As mentioned before `WhatsNewKit` can be fully customized to your needs. The Advanced section will explain all configuration possibilities and features of `WhatsNewKit` in detail. First off it's important to understand the components of the `WhatsNewViewController` in order to customize the behaviour and `UI`-Design.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/UILayout.jpg" width="500">
</p>

### WhatsNewViewController.Configuration
The [WhatsNewViewController.Configuration](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Configuration/WhatsNewViewController%2BConfiguration.swift) struct enables you to customize the `WhatsNewViewController` to your needs.

The `WhatsNewViewController.Configuration` consist of three main properties.

| Property      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `theme`      | All `UI` related settings can be customized here |
| `detailButton`      | Optional detail button to configure the title and the action that should be performed after pressing |
| `completionButton` | The completion button to configure the title and the corresponding action that should take place after pressing |

The configuration itself can be passed to the initializer of the `WhatsNewViewController`.

```swift
// Initialize default Configuration
let configuration = WhatsNewViewController.Configuration()

// Initialize WhatsNewViewController with custom configuration
let whatsNewViewController = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: whatsNew, 
    configuration: configuration
)
```

The upcoming subsection will explain the properties `Theme`, `DetailButton` and `CompletionButton` in detail.

#### Theme
The [WhatsNewViewController.Theme](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Theme/WhatsNewViewController%2BTheme.swift) struct allows you to perfectly match the design to your existing App. The following table list the available properties.

| Property      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `backgroundColor`      | The backgroun color of the WhatsNewViewController |
| `titleViewTheme`      | Customize the font and text color of the TitleView |
| `itemsViewTheme` | Adjust title and subtitle via text color and font as well as the auto tint image option |
| `detailButtonTheme` | Title color and font of the DetailButton |
| `completionButtonTheme` | Configure title color and font for the CompletionButton |

##### Templates

Beside the full configuration possibilities you can make use of the predefined [Templates](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Theme/WhatsNewViewController%2BTheme.swift) which are available as static properties on a Theme. All templates are available in white and dark mode üòé.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/Templates.jpg" width="600">
</p>

```swift
// Dark Red template Theme
let darkRed = WhatsNewViewController.Theme.darkRed

// White Red template Theme
let whiteRed = WhatsNewViewController.Theme.whiteRed
```

For a full overview of the available Templates check out the [Example-Application](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/tree/master/Example).

##### Animation
<img align="right" width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/Animations.gif" alt="Animations" />

By setting the `animation` property on the `WhatsNewViewController.ItemsViewTheme` you can apply an animation while displaying the `ItemsView`.

```swift
// Set custom animation for displaying WhatsNew.Item's
theme.itemsViewTheme.animation = .custom(animator: { [weak self] (view: UIView, index: Int) in
    // view: The View to perform animation on
    // index: The current WhatsNew.Item index (starting at zero)
})
```
Or you can make use of the predefined animations like `fade`, `slideUp`, `slideDown`, `slideLeft`, `slideRight`.

```swift
// Set predefined slideUp theme
theme.itemsViewTheme.animation = .slideUp
```
> ‚òùÔ∏è In default the Animation is set to `.none`

#### DetailButton
 <img width="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/detailButton.jpg" alt="DetailButton">
 
By setting an [DetailButton](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Configuration/WhatsNewViewController%2BDetailButton.swift) struct on the `WhatsNewViewController.Configuration` struct you can customize the `title` and the corresponding `action` of the displayed detail button on the `WhatsNewViewController`. As the `DetailButton` struct is declared as optional the `WhatsNewViewController` will only display the button if a `DetailButton` configuration is available

| Action | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `website` | When the user pressed the detail button a `SFSafariViewController` with the given `URL` will be presented |
| `custom` | After the detail button has been pressed by the user, your custom action will be invoked |

```swift
// Initialize DetailButton with title and open website at url
let detailButton = WhatsNewViewController.DetailButton(
    title: "Read more", 
    action: .website(url: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit")
)

// Initialize DetailButton with title and custom action
let detailButton = WhatsNewViewController.DetailButton(
    title: "Read more", 
    action: .custom(action: { [weak self] whatsNewViewController in {
        // Perform custom action on detail button pressed
    })
)
```

#### CompletionButton
 <img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/completionButton.jpg" alt="CompletionButton">
 
The [CompletionButton](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Configuration/WhatsNewViewController%2BCompletionButton.swift) struct configures the displayed title and the action when the user pressed the completion button on the `WhatsNewViewController`.

| Action | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `dismiss` | When the user pressed the completion button, the `WhatsNewViewController` will be dismissed. This is the default value |
| `custom` | After the completion button has been pressed by the user, your custom action will be invoked |

```swift
// Initialize CompletionButton with title and dismiss action
let completionButton = WhatsNewViewController.CompletionButton(
    title: "Continue", 
    action: .dismiss
)

// Initialize CompletionButton with title and custom action
let completionButton = WhatsNewViewController.CompletionButton(
    title: "Continue", 
    action: .custom(action: { [weak self] whatsNewViewController in {
        // Perform custom action on completion button pressed
    })
)
```

#### HapticFeedback
You can enable on both `DetailButton` and `CompletionButton` haptic feedback when the user pressed one of these buttons. Either by setting the property or passing it to the initializer.

```swift
// Impact Feedback
button.hapticFeedback = .impact

// Selection Feedback
button.hapticFeedback = .selection

// Notification Feedback with type
let completionButton = WhatsNewViewController.CompletionButton(
    title: "Continue", 
    action: .dismiss,
    hapticFeedback: .notification(.success)
)
```
> ‚òùÔ∏è In default the `HapticFeedback` is `nil` indicating no haptic feedback should be executed.

### WhatsNewVersionStore
<p align="center">
   <img width="750" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/WhatsNewVersionStore.jpg" alt="WhatsNewVersionStore">
</p>

If we speak about presenting awesome new app features we have to take care that this kind of `UI` action only happens once if the user installed the app or opened it after an update. The `WhatsNewKit` offers a protocol oriented solution for this kind of problem via the [WhatsNewVersionStore](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Store/WhatsNewVersionStore.swift) protocol.

```swift
/// WhatsNewVersionStore typealias protocol composition
public typealias WhatsNewVersionStore = WriteableWhatsNewVersionStore & ReadableWhatsNewVersionStore

public protocol WriteableWhatsNewVersionStore {
    func set(version: WhatsNew.Version)
}

public protocol ReadableWhatsNewVersionStore {
    func has(version: WhatsNew.Version) -> Bool
}
```

The `WhatsNewViewController` will use the APIs of the `WhatsNewVersionStore` in the following way.

| API      	   | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `has(version:)` | Checks if the `Whatsnew.Version` is available and will return `nil` during initialization. |
| `set(version:)` | The `WhatsNew.Version` will be set after the `CompletionButton` has been pressed. |

The `WhatsNewVersionStore` can be passed as an parameter to the initializer. If you do so the initializer will become `optional`.

```swift
// Initialize WhatsNewViewController with WhatsNewVersionStore
let whatsNewViewController: WhatsNewViewController? = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: whatsNew, 
    versionStore: myVersionStore
)

// Check if WhatsNewViewController is available to present it.
if let controller = whatsNewViewController {
    // Present it as WhatsNewViewController is available 
    // after init with WhatsNewVersionStore
    self.present(controller, animated: true)
} else {
    // WhatsNewViewController is `nil` this Version has already been presented
}
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è Please keep in mind the `WhatsNewViewController` initializer will only become `optional` and checks if the Version has been already presented if you pass a `WhatsNewVersionStore` object.

#### Implementation
If you already handled saving user settings in your app to something like `Realm`, `CoreData` or `UserDefaults` you can conform that to the `WhatsNewVersionStore`.

```swift
// Extend your existing App-Logic
extension MyUserSettingsDatabase: WhatsNewVersionStore {
    // Implement me üë®‚Äçüíª
}
```

#### Predefined Implementations

`WhatsNewKit` brings along two predefined Implementations of the `WhatsNewVersionStore`.

##### KeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore

The [KeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Store/KeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore.swift) saves and retrieves the `WhatsNew.Version` via a `KeyValueable` protocol conform object. `UserDefaults` and `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore` are already conform to that protocol üôå

```swift
// Local KeyValueStore
let keyValueVersionStore = KeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore(
    keyValueable: UserDefaults.standard
)

// iCloud KeyValueStore
let keyValueVersionStore = KeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore(
    keyValueable: NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default
)

// Initialize WhatsNewViewController with KeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore
let whatsNewViewController: WhatsNewViewController? = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: whatsNew, 
    versionStore: keyValueVersionStore
)
```

##### InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore

The [InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Store/InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore.swift) saves and retrieves the `WhatsNew.Version` in memory. Perfect for development or testing phase üë®‚Äçüíª

```swift
// Initialize WhatsNewViewController with InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore
let whatsNewViewController: WhatsNewViewController? = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: whatsNew, 
    versionStore: InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore()
)
```

#### WhatsNew.Version
During the initialization of the `WhatsNew` struct the `WhatsNewKit` will automatically retrieve the current App-Version via the [CFBundleShortVersionString](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html) and construct a [WhatsNew.Version](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit/blob/master/Sources/Models/WhatsNew%2BVersion.swift) for you which is used by the `WhatsNewVersionStore` protocol in order to persist the presented app versions. If you want to manually set the version you can do it like the following example.

```swift
// Initialize Version 1.0.0
let version = WhatsNew.Version(
    major: 1,
    minor: 0,
    patch: 0
)

// Use a String literal
let version = WhatsNew.Version(stringLiteral: "1.0.0")

// Current Version in Bundle (Default)
let version = WhatsNew.Version.current()
```

After you initialize a `WhatsNew.Version` you can pass it to the initializer of a `WhatsNew` struct.

```swift
// Initialize WhatsNew with Title and Items
let whatsNew = WhatsNew(
    version: version,
    title: "WhatsNewKit",
    items: []
)
```

### Codable WhatsNew
The `WhatsNew` struct is conform the `Codable` protocol which allows you to initialize a `WhatsNew` struct via `JSON`.

```JSON
{
    "version": {
        "major": 1,
        "minor": 0,
        "patch": 0
    },
    "title": "WhatsNewKit",
    "items": [
        {
            "title": "Open Source",
            "subtitle": "Contributions are very welcome üë®‚Äçüíª",
            "image": "data:image/png;base64,R0lG42......."
        }
    ]
}
```
The optional `image` property of the `WhatsNew.Item` will be decoded and encoded in [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).

```swift
// Encode to JSON
let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(whatsNew)

// Decode from JSON data
let decoded = try? JSONDecoder().decode(WhatsNew.self, from: data)
```
